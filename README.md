# Generative AI Data Augmentation Tool
This project is designed to augment datasets using Generative AI models to boost the efficiency of machine learning workflows.

## Description
 Users can upload datasets and generate synthetic data using various augmentation techniques (e.g., for image, text, or tabular data). The project leverages NVIDIA AI Workbench for training, managing, and deploying models, ensuring scalability and high performance.

## Features
- Upload Dataset: Users can upload datasets in image, text, or tabular format.
- Data Augmentation: Various augmentation techniques (e.g., image transformations, synthetic text generation, tabular data augmentation) are available to enhance the dataset.
- Synthetic Data Generation: Leverage pre-trained Generative AI models to create new synthetic data for the uploaded dataset.
- Data Export: Augmented data can be downloaded or integrated into machine learning pipelines via API.

## Planned Core Functionalities
1. Dataset Upload: Support for image, text, and tabular data formats.
2. Augmentation Type Selection: Options for different augmentation techniques based on data type.
3. Synthetic Data Generation: Realistic synthetic data generated using AI models such as GANs for images, transformers for text, and CTGAN for tabular data.
4. Integration with NVIDIA AI Workbench: Using Workbench for model training, deployment, and optimization.

## Project structure
- /frontend: Code for the web interface (likely built with React or Vue.js).
- /backend: API services and logic to handle data preprocessing, augmentation, and synthetic data generation (Flask or FastAPI).
- /models: Pre-trained generative models for each data type (GANs for images, transformers for text, CTGAN for tabular data).
- /scripts: Utility scripts for setting up NVIDIA AI Workbench, managing dependencies, and running model training workflows.

## Installation
Prerequisites:
- NVIDIA AI Workbench installed and configured on your system.
- Docker (optional, for containerized development).
- Python 3.8+, with pip installed.

- Clone the repository: 
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/GenerativeAI-DataAugmentation.git
cd GenerativeAI-DataAugmentation
- Create and activate a virtual environment:
    - python3 -m venv venv
    - source venv/bin/activate
- Install dependencies:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
- Set up NVIDIA AI Workbench:
    1. Follow the NVIDIA AI Workbench installation guide.
    2. Configure the project environment for your generative models (GANs, NLP, CTGAN).

## Usage
Once the project is set up, users will be able to:
1. Upload their dataset via the web interface.
2. elect augmentation options based on the data type.
3. Generate and download synthetic data, or access it through an API.

## Roadmap
 - Basic functionality for image data augmentation (using simple transformations).
 - Integration with pre-trained GAN models for more complex image generation.
 - Support for text data augmentation using transformer models.
 - Augmentation for tabular data (CTGAN or similar models).
 - Frontend user interface for dataset upload and augmentation selection.
 - Final deployment using NVIDIA AI Workbench.
