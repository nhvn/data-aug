# AugmentAI: Enhancing Machine Learning Workflows with Generative AI

## Introduction
In this blog post, I'll walk you through my experience developing **AugmentAI**, a tool designed to augment datasets using **Generative AI** models. This project aims to solve the problem of data scarcity in machine learning by generating synthetic data to improve model training.

## Key Features
- **Image Augmentation**: Utilizing pre-trained GANs for generating synthetic images.
- **Integration with NVIDIA AI Workbench**: Accelerated model training using GPU resources.
- **Future Expansion**: Plans to add text and tabular data augmentation.

## Challenges and Learnings
While building AugmentAI, I faced hardware limitations and worked around them by designing the project for future GPU scalability. I also integrated NVIDIA AI Workbench, which was a new and powerful tool for me.

## Tips and Tricks for Future Developers
- **Utilize Pre-trained Models**: Start with pre-trained models to save time and resources.
- **Leverage GPU Acceleration**: If possible, use GPU resources early in the development to cut down training times.
  
## Conclusion
AugmentAI is just the beginning. I plan to add more features, including text and tabular data augmentation, and improve the modelâ€™s performance by leveraging better hardware in the future.
